### Course Description
This hands-on course will introduce exploratory data analysis (EDA), image preprocessing, and deep learning models for those who wish to explore deep learning for the digital humanities. This course will first introduce computer vision in deep learning, then exploratory data analysis using Google Colab. After that, participants will train GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) and cGANs (conditional Generative Adversarial Networks) models to colorize black-and-white images. Throughout this course, participants will be able to create their own datasets for deep learning and run deep learning models with them. Prior programming experience is NOT required to take this course.

### Required Software
Google Colab: a cloud-based notebook environment which is suitable for machine learning and data analysis. A Google account is required to use Colab. Participants are not required to purchase a Colab membership for this course since we will only be using the free features.

### Required GitHub Account
GitHub: Participants need to sign up for GitHub in order to access course materials. Participants do not have to get a Pro membership.

### Learning Objectives
By the end of the workshop, participants will:

-	Be familiar with generative models and their deep learning functions.
-	Collect and preprocess data for deep learning.
-	Deploy deep learning models for computer vision tasks.
-	Successfully create humanities datasets and share them with the public.
